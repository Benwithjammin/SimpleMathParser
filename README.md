Simple Math Parser
=========================

A simple string - math parser, using an implementation of the shunting-yard algorithm. The core implementation is not my own, it is taken from here - http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/351042/Shunting-Yard-algorithm-in-Csharp. Dont re-invent the wheel, and re-invent it square shaped!

###Running it

To get up and running:
  1. Clone this repo
  2. Enable nuget package restore in VS and build
  3. Run the MathParser .exe console application
